# Air Distance Calculator

The purpose of the air distance calculator web application is to allow users to calculate the air distance between two locations. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the latitude and longitude coordinates of two points. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application calculates the air distance between the two points and displays the result in kilometers.

The application serves as a tool for users who need to quickly determine the distance between two locations in a straight line. It can be useful for various purposes such as trip planning, navigation, and geographical analysis.

Additionally, the application can be further enhanced by integrating a free map API to allow users to input addresses instead of coordinates, thereby providing a more user-friendly experience.
